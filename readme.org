* Spiderweb
  Wiki software built on the idea of creating many interconnecting links between
  ideas, much like a spiderweb
* Setup
  - Make a file ~conf.lisp~ in the main directory with the rest of the source
  - Start ~conf.lisp~ with the following contents
#+begin_src lisp
(in-package :web)
#+end_src
** Setting Up Storage
*** Local Files
    - If you can store the files locally (on the same machine the server is running
      from), the setup is easy: add the following lines to ~conf.lisp~
  #+begin_src lisp
  (defparameter *storage-type* :local)
  (defparameter *base-path* "<path to the folder where the data will be stored>/")
  #+end_src
*** S3
    - If you can't store the files with the server, perhaps because you're using
      something like Heroku to run the application, you'll need to set it up to use
      Amazon S3
      1. Add a line to ~conf.lisp~: ~(defparameter *storage-type* :s3)~
      2. Save your AWS credentials to a file ~$HOME/.aws~
      3. That's it!
