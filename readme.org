* Spiderweb
  Wiki software built on the idea of creating many interconnecting links between
  ideas, much like a spiderweb
* Setup
  - Make a file ~conf.lisp~ in the main directory with the rest of the source
  - Start ~conf.lisp~ with the following contents
#+begin_src lisp
(in-package :web)
#+end_src
** Storage
*** Local Files
    - If you can store the files locally (on the same machine the server is running
      from), the setup is easy: add the following lines to ~conf.lisp~
  #+begin_src lisp
  (defparameter *storage-type* :local)
  (defparameter *base-path* "<path to the folder where the data will be stored>/")
  #+end_src
*** S3
    - Not implemented yet
** Proxy
   - Spiderweb wiki is designed to be run behind a reverse-proxy, like nginx
   - The following is a sample nginx configuration
  #+begin_src conf
  http {
       upstream hunchentoot {
         server 127.0.0.1:5000;
       }

       server {
         listen 80;
	 listen [::]:80;
	 server_name wiki.example.com;

	 location / {
	          proxy_pass http://hunchentoot;
         }
       }
  }
  #+end_src
